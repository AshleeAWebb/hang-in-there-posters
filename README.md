# Hang in There  

### Absract:
> The webpage we built allows for users to randomly view an insperational image paired with a title and quote. If a user likes the current poster they can save it and view their saved posters. They can also delete their saved posters, as well as, create their own poster(image, title and quote) and save it. This code solves the problem of randomly displaying an image, quote, and title, as well as, managing storage of the users saved posters. The application solves these problems by generating a random number that is assigned to an index value of an array. These array's have a list of images, titles and quotes with an index position. The images, titles and quotes in these positions are then displayed on the main page. 

### Installation Instructions:
> The steps a person would take to clone down and run the app would be as follows:

> 1. Fork the GitHub repository file
> 2. Using the git clone command on their terminal, they could initiate a copy of the required files.
> 3. Once they have cloned the application, they would be able to cd into the directory, and using the open index.HTML string of text it would open the application in their own web browsers so they could enjoy the functionality of the application.

### Context:
> We worked on it everyday between 4 and 6 hours for 6 days. We are about to be starting week 3 so almost half way through Turing Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
> Our goals were to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript, especially OOP( Object Oriented Programming), DOM(Document Object Model), and DRY and SRP style. We also learned how JavaScript, CSS, and HTML all interact with one another to create a functioning application. This project also ensured that we understood crucial skills in GIT, such as working with a partner to keep repositories free of merge conflicts through effective communication and working on branches later reviewed and pulled down by the other partner. We used GitHub, VS Code, The Terminal, Zoom, Slack, and websites such as Slack Over Flow, Mozilla Developer Network.

### Wins + Challenges:
> Finishing this project was a win. The knowledge gained of git workflow, javascript and working with a partner were all wins. The whole project was challenging. We overcame each challenge by first psuedocoding, putting our heads together, writing code, and checking the code along the way with console.logs and alerts. If we were still stuck we'd start researching the web for answers and lastly we would reach out to rocks, fellow cohort mates and upper cohort friends. Another big win was reaching out sooner than later.
